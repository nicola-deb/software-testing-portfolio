## RESTful Web Application Project 

**Project Overview: User Account Management System**

The [User Account Management System](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/my-user-management-app) is a web application designed to facilitate the management of user accounts to showcase various programming languages, technologies and test tools. <br>

Please see the [README](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/my-user-management-app/README.md) file for details of features, technologies and testing tools used in the implementation & test of this application.


## UI Automation Testing Project

This is a practical project where I use automation to test login, withdrawal and deposit features of a Banking Web Application as part of a Test Automation Course with Dublin Coding School, 2024. 
 
Within the [cypress-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/Automation_Testing/cypress-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Cypress front-end testing tool, based on JavaScript. 

Within the [selenium-script](https://github.com/nicola-deb/software-testing-portfolio/tree/main/Automation_Testing/selenium-script) folder, you will find a test script that uses the Selenium test automation tool, based on Java.
